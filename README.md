# LangGraph Agentic AI

## Overview
LangGraph Agentic AI is a modular and scalable framework designed to build intelligent agent-based applications using graph-based architectures. This project integrates various AI models, tools, and state management techniques to enable efficient AI-driven workflows.

## Features
- **Graph-Based AI Processing**: Organize AI workflows as graphs for better modularity and scalability.
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Implement AI agents with specialized functions.
- **Vector Storage**: Store and retrieve embeddings efficiently.
- **Modular Components**: Easily extend functionality using tools and nodes.
- **State Management**: Maintain and track AI states throughout the workflow.
